## Introduction
Decision Trees are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. This project highlights:
- Theoretical foundations of Decision Trees.
- Practical implementation using Python.
- Applications in various industries.

## What is a Decision Tree?
A Decision Tree represents decisions and their possible outcomes in a hierarchical structure. Key components:
- **Nodes**: Represent questions or decisions.
- **Branches**: Represent possible outcomes of decisions.
- **Root Node**: The starting point that represents the entire dataset.
- **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal nodes indicating the predicted class or value.

### Example
Deciding whether to carry an umbrella:
- If it's raining: Take the umbrella.
- If it's cloudy: Check the forecast. If rain is predicted, take it; otherwise, don’t.

## Why Use Decision Trees?
Decision Trees offer several advantages:
- **Ease of Interpretation**: Mimics human decision-making.
- **Versatility**: Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- **Minimal Preprocessing**: No need for data scaling.

## Metrics for Splitting Data

### Gini Impurity
Measures the likelihood of incorrect classification:
\[ \text{Gini} = 1 - \sum (p_i^2) \]

Example:
- Dataset with 40% apples and 60% oranges:
  \[ \text{Gini} = 1 - (0.4^2 + 0.6^2) = 0.48 \]

Lower Gini values indicate better splits.

### Information Gain
Measures improvement in classification:
\[ \text{Info Gain} = \text{Entropy(Parent)} - \text{Weighted Avg[Entropy(Children)]} \]

In Python, you can use `criterion='entropy'` in scikit-learn for splits based on Information Gain.

## Building a Decision Tree in Python
This repository includes a step-by-step demonstration of building a Decision Tree using Python and the Iris dataset. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## Visualizing Decision Trees
The `plot_tree()` function in scikit-learn enables easy visualization:
- Understand how the data is split.
- Identify thresholds for each split.

---

## Limitations and Overfitting
While Decision Trees are highly interpretable, they have some drawbacks:
- **Overfitting**: Prone to fitting noise in small or noisy datasets.
- **Sensitivity**: Small changes in data can drastically alter the tree.

Mitigation strategies:
- Pruning
- Ensemble methods like Random Forests

---

## Applications of Decision Trees
Decision Trees are widely used in various industries:
- **Healthcare**: Diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.
- **E-commerce**: Recommending products to users.
- **Finance**: Approving or rejecting loan applications.
